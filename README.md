- 👋 Hi, I’m @Naoko-Kry
- 👀 I’m interested in github, backstage, and all things privacy at work. Off work, I enjoy dancing, trying to read books and doing nothing. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more privacy and github. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to data privacy!
- 📫 How to reach me @naoko on slack or the #team-privacy-tooling-and-infra
